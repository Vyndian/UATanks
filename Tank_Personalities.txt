This file details the different "Personalities" that can be given to any enemy tank in UATanks. This will not cover the particulars of how these personalities are coded,
but rather the actions that each personality will take and the reasons for their behaviors.


Personality 1 - Hunter
The Hunter tank has one job -- to kill their target, the player. They will chase the player to the ends of the earth, avoiding obstacles as necessary,
but otherwise heading straight for the player from any distance. Once they close with the player, they shoot to kill. If their target dies,
they find a new target. They aren't suicidal, though. If they are hurt badly, they will retreat and heal. This is currently the only personality than can heal.

Takeaways:
-Chases the player from any distance
   ~Avoids obstacles as necessary
-Fires at the player with high accuracy
-Will retreat if badly injured
-Will heal once retreat has succeeded
-Will commence the attack once fully healed
-Will find a new target once the original has been eliminated


Personality 2 - Guard
The Guard tank patrols around the maps using a series of waypoints, avoiding obstacles as necessary. Once the last waypoint is reached,
the Guard will either stop there, head back to the first waypoint to start over, or start the series over in reverse.
When the Guard hears a player approaching, it will look for the player, once fire at the player once it has Line of Sight.
Once there intruder is neutralized or leaves the premises, the Guard returns to its patrolling.
Also, if the Guard is protecting a Caravan (see Personality 4 below), and that Caravan is killed, the Guard becomes a Hunter.

Takeaways:
-Patrols through a series of waypoints in the world
   ~Avoids obstacles as necessary
-Option of 3 behaviors once the last waypoint is reached:
   ~Stop there and simply fire at nearby players
   ~Go back to the first waypoint and start the series over
   ~Perform the series in reverse
      --Will reverse again once the original first waypoint is reached
-Stops patrolling to look for players is hears (by turning, not moving)
-Fires at the heard player if it sees that player
-Returns to patrolling once the intruder is either gone or neutralized
-If this Guard is protecting a Caravan, and that Caravan dies, the Guard will change to the Hunter personality
   ~Of course, follows Hunter protocalls once the change is made


Personality 3 - Assassin
The Assassin will attempt to hide (by staying where the designer places it in its world block) until it sees a player,
than firing off a fast, deadly shot before turning itself into a Hunter personality, meaning it will then chase the player,
attacking at any opportunity and flee is badly damaged. In this way, the Assassin may also heal itself,
but only in the sense that it becomes a Hunter once the first assassination attempt is made.

Takeaways:
-Hides in one place until it sees a player
   ~Does not seek out this hiding spot. Must be placed there by the designer, or spawned in its appropriate spot
-Once a player is heard, attempts to line up a shot by rotating toward the player
-Once the shot is lined up, attempts to assassinate the player by firing off a shot that is more deadly and travels faster than a normal round
-Once the assassination attempt is made, changes Personality to Hunter
   ~Of course, follows Hunter protocalls once the change is made


Personality 4 - Caravan
The Caravan tank is big, slow, has a lot of health, and is worth a great deal of points (All three variables decided by designers,
but are meant to follow this pattern). It attempts to traverse from one waypoint to another and back again (or perhaps a longer series of waypoints),
a lot like a Guard, but the Caravan does not fight back, or even flee-- at least, not at first. Caravans work alongside a Guard who travels with
the Caravan, protecting it from behind and to the right. Once that Guard is destroyed, the Caravan will flee any player that approaches it.
Whenever a Caravan completes a full circuit, the points that killing it is worth drops.

Takeaways:
-Meant to be slow, have high health, and be worth a great deal of points
-Ping-pongs or loops across the map like a Guard
   ~However, does not fight back like a Guard would
-The points it is worth drops every time the Caravan completes a curcuit
-Alway has a Guard protecting it, which will travel behind and to the right of the Caravan
-If the Guard is killed, the Caravan will flee any players
   ~Will hide after a while if it doesn't hear any players
-If the Caravan is killed, the Guard will become a vengeful Hunter
